# Hot Desking Frontend

Currently this will not communicate with the backend api, this is just a UI

## Setup

1. Install [npm] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) - I'm using version 10.2.4
2. In the frontend folder, run `npm install`
3. If npm lists security vulnerabilities, thats currently expected (the vulnerabilities should dissapear in the production server)

## npm tricks

1. Start the server (in development mode) with `npm start` in the frontend folder
